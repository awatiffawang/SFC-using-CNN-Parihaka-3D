# Seismic facies class prediction using Unet based on Parihaka-3D dataset

Seismic Facies Classification (SFC) is a technique of classifying different geologic regions of seismic images (facies). This is done to understand the characteristic of target reservoir based on it related properties and heterogenities. Facies interpretation is determined by seismic reflector information such as reflection geometry, lateral continuity and amplitude (SEG Wiki, 2019).In this project, the author aims to predict seismic facies in a deep learning multi-class semantic segmentation problem based on seismic Parihaka-3D dataset. It is a public domain data interpreted with labels released by SEG in 2020 Machine Learning Challange.
